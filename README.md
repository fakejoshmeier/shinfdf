# fdf
The first project of 42's Graphic's branch.  With a .fdf file inputed, the program should read the file and output a wireframe based on the dimensions given in the .fdf.  This will all be done with mlx, which is a garbage pile of a library, akin to coding by scratching on your hard drive with a heated needle.
